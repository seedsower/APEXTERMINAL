# APex Commodity Security Audits

APex Commodity is built on a secure and audited codebase. The following security audits were conducted on the original codebase:

- [Neodyme Audit (Protocol V2)](https://github.com/drift-labs/audits/blob/master/protocol-v2/neodyme.pdf)
- [Trail of Bits Audit (Protocol V2)](https://github.com/drift-labs/audits/blob/master/protocol-v2/tob.pdf)

## Disclaimer

While the underlying protocol has been audited, APex Commodity may have made modifications to the original codebase. Users are encouraged to conduct their own security assessments.
